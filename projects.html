        Besides working on my class work, I enjoy making security cameras for my family's house.
        The security cameras that I've built have changed from iteration to iteration; however,
        everytime I build a new camera, I learn something new about programing and visual
        processing. Furthermore, I learn how to make them more cost effective and tailored for
        each project.

        the peep hole of my front door" id="camera1"/>

        <img src="images/securitycamera4.jpeg" alt="Photo of the first camera I built but it's how it
        looks from the window" id="camera4"/>

        <img src="images/securitycamera2.jpeg" alt="Photo of the second camera I built using a
        logitech webcame with no IR" id="camera2"/>

        <img src="images/securitycamera3.jpeg" alt="Photo of the third camera I built can detect
        IR and is water proof" id="camera3"/>

    <p>
        The first two photos are of the first camera I've ever built and it lets my family see
        when packages arrive at the door. The third photo is of my second camera which had higher
        quality streaming and was water proof but was too difficult to modify into night vision.
        The last image is of my most recent camera which is can see at night and is water proof.
        The case was 3D printed using tinkercad!
